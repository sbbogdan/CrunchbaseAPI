Crunchbase REST API - quickstart sample (Python)

I had been looking for a searching for a simple Crunchbase REST API example, but could not find one. I decided to upload a very small sample myself to save you the effort, assist with getting going quickly. You will need an Crunchbase API key, see documentation below for how to request/purchase one.

I referenced/heavily borrowed from the following code, documentation:
* [Crunchbase API - How do I get API access?](https://support.crunchbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010466447-How-do-I-get-API-access-)
* [Crunchbase API - Using the API](https://data.crunchbase.com/docs/using-the-api)
