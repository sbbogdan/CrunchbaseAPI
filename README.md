Crunchbase REST API - quickstart sample (Python)

I had been searching for a simple Crunchbase REST API example but could not find one. I decided to create a small sample to save others the effort. You will need an Crunchbase API key, details for acquiring one below.

I referenced/heavily borrowed from the following code, documentation:
* [Crunchbase API - How do I get API access?](https://support.crunchbase.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010466447-How-do-I-get-API-access-)
* [Crunchbase API - Using the API](https://data.crunchbase.com/docs/using-the-api)
